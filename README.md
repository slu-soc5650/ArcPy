### Using `ArcPy` in SOC 4650/5650
[`ArcPy`](http://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/arcpy/get-started/what-is-arcpy-.htm) is the [Python](https://www.python.org) package that supports a programmatic approach to map document creation in ArcGIS. Not all functions in ArcGIS can be completed using `ArcPy`. For example, map documents cannot be created and symbology cannot be set using `ArcPy`. Despite some limitations, it does offer an excellent way to increase the efficiency and reproducibility of map production.

If you are interested in learning `ArcPy`, I will provide minimal documentation that mirrors the documents I provide for Stata. These will include quick reference sheets and replication files. These replication files can be viewed in Atom without installing additional packages. You can also write Python script in Atom.

If you use `ArcPy` to create assignment documents, feel free to submit your code for review along with your map products.

### About SOC 4650/5650: Introduction to Geographic Information Science
This class introduces both the theoretical and technical skills that constitute the nascent field of Geographic Information Science (GISc). Techniques introduced include data cleaning and management, map production and cartography, and the manipulation of both tabular and spatial data. The impacts of GISc on public policy, and the effects of public policy on GISc, are also discussed. The course incorporates a wide variety of social, economic, health, urban, meteorological, and environmental data. These data are mapped at a variety of extents, from the City of St. Louis to the St. Louis Metropolitan region, Missouri, all United States counties, and all U.S. states.
